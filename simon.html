        <h1>About Simon</h1>
        <p>Simon Pryce has followed in his grandparent’s footsteps, who were both highly accomplished and respected opera singers.<br><br>

          After finishing school he studied Sports Science later making a change to study acting and was accepted into Theatre Nepean 
          at the University of Western Sydney. Apart from performances in productions such as Cats, South Pacific and Fidelio with Opera 
          Australia, Simon played the role of the Phantom in the Phantom of the Opera in Australia and through out Asia for five years!<br><br>
           
          Simon brings a dynamic presence to the stage and on film. His transition from The Music of The Night to singing Simon Says and 
          Fruit Salad is a dream come true for Simon who says that being a Wiggle is “beyond performing” and that “it’s a privilege to be 
          able to be part of a team that has such an impact on children and their families.”<br><br>
           
          With a Sports Science background, Simon’s health and fitness regime keeps him in good stead with a gruelling touring schedule, 
          staying healthy and doing physical activity everyday is a big part of Simon’s life. But it is his role as the Red Wiggle, that 
          brings him the most joy. Always with a smile from ear to ear, he loves to sing and dance and encourage audiences to sing and 
          dance along too.
