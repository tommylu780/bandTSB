        <h1 class="member-name">About Lachy</h1>
        <p>Lachlan Gillespie, the boy from Brisbane, began playing the piano when he was four years old and has enjoyed playing it ever since, 
            and these days, accompanying his singing and song writing.<br><br>

          Lachy graduated from The Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), with a Bachelor Degree in Music Theatre. WAAPA graduates 
          include international stars such as Hugh Jackman and Tim Minchin.<br><br>
          
          His Wiggly life started after a successful audition, jumping into the role of Captain Feathersword for the Dorothy the Dinosaur shows. 
          Choosing to wear The Wiggles purple shirt meant assuming the role of the sleepy Wiggle. Now children will call “Wake up, Lachy!” For 
          Lachy, becoming a Wiggle is a dream come true, especially as it’s one of the few jobs in the world where you get paid to sleep on the 
          job!<br><br>
          
          Lachy is now co-producing The Wiggles albums with his friend and mentor, Anthony Field (Blue Wiggle). The  success of the Lachy! TV 
          series, seen around the world, has added a new branch to The Wiggles enterprise in CD’s, DVD’s and characters like his good friend Ponso 
          The Pony.
