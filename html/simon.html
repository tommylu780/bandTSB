        <h1 class="member-name">About Simon</h1>
        <p>Simon Pryce has followed in his grandparent’s footsteps, who were both highly accomplished and respected opera singers.<br><br> After finishing school he studied Sports Science later making a change to study acting and was accepted into Theatre
            Nepean at the University of Western Sydney. Apart from performances in productions such as Cats, South Pacific and Fidelio with Opera Australia, Simon played the role of the Phantom in the Phantom of the Opera in Australia and through out
            Asia for five years!<br><br> Simon brings a dynamic presence to the stage and on film. His transition from The Music of The Night to singing Simon Says and Fruit Salad is a dream come true for Simon who says that being a Wiggle is “beyond
            performing” and that “it’s a privilege to be able to be part of a team that has such an impact on children and their families.”<br><br> With a Sports Science background, Simon’s health and fitness regime keeps him in good stead with a gruelling
            touring schedule, staying healthy and doing physical activity everyday is a big part of Simon’s life. But it is his role as the Red Wiggle, that brings him the most joy. Always with a smile from ear to ear, he loves to sing and dance and encourage
            audiences to sing and dance along too.
