        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Who are the Wiggles!</h3>
        <p class="para">The Wiggles have been entertaining and delighting children for decades. There must be few children’s entertainers who can make the same claim. While the original line-up has changed, their popularity continues and the reason for this is simple.
            They see things from the perspective of the child. It is the basic tenet that informs their work. Because their performances are developmentally appropriate for their young audiences, they continue to attract and involve those audiences.<br><br>            Three of the original Wiggles, Anthony Field, Murray Cook and Greg Page met at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, where they were studying to be early childhood educators. A common interest in music, together with their professional
            interest in early childhood, led to them developing a CD of children’s songs that would, they hoped, be a useful addition to those already in the market. At the same time Anthony was involved in a pop band, The Cockroaches and persuaded a
            member of that band, Jeff Fatt, to be part of the new project. That first CD was an immediate success and led to another and another, to videos, DVDs, television series and live shows that have established the group’s reputation as first class
            entertainers of young children across the world.<br><br> The Wiggles appeal is international for they value and respect children. Because the material they present continues to focus so precisely on children’s interests and needs, their success
            seems well set to continue into the future. <br>
