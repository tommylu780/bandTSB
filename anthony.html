        <h1>About Anthony</h1>
        <p>Anthony is the youngest of seven children! All of the Field children were taught a musical instrument and Anthony learned the violin. 
            In high school Anthony took up the guitar and formed a band called The Cockroaches with two of his brothers. This pop band became a 
            chart sensation in Australia with a top ten hit and album sales reaching gold and platinum status.<br><br>

          When the band came to an end Anthony went to university and obtained a degree in Early Childhood Studies. On completion, Anthony took 
          the step of combining his studies in Early Childhood with his musical background and so The Wiggles were formed in 1991. As the creator 
          of The Wiggles, Anthony Field has been Wiggling from the beginning.<br><br>
          
          “What a milestone we have reached, loving it as much as ever, and of course also meeting our wonderful audiences all over the world!”<br><br>
          
          Anthony has produced The Wiggles music for most of their career and is the Creative Director of their exciting live shows. He is very 
          proud that Emma, Lachy and Simon have become as much a part of the lives of young Wiggle fans as all The Wiggles before them.  Anthony 
          feels The Wiggles, from their inception, have had a principal objective to give children a positive experience and an “ownership of music”. 
          He believes it is still a guiding principal to each Wiggles theatrical experience.
